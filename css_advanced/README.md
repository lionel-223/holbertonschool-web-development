# Advanced CSS Project

## Description
This project focuses on building and refining advanced CSS skills by applying styles to a webpage structure. The goal is to start from a well-structured HTML layout (already implemented or provided) and progressively enhance it with complex CSS techniques, adhering to best practices and ensuring that the final look matches the provided design specifications.

## Objectives
By the end of this project, I aim to:
- Understand what CSS is and how to add styles to elements.
- Implement a variety of selectors and classes for flexible, maintainable styling.
- Understand and apply the concept of CSS specificity to resolve conflicts.
- Master the use of CSS box model properties for layout and spacing.
- Ensure the webpage visually aligns with the provided Figma design mockups.
- Adhere to coding best practices and validate the code with W3C tools.

## Requirements
- All files should end with a newline.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- Do not install, import, or use external libraries (no NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.). Only pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript is allowed.
- The code should be W3C compliant and validate successfully with the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

## Tools and Resources
- [Figma Design](#) *(Add a link to the specific Figma file if possible)*.
- [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [MDN CSS Best Practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
