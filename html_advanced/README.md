# Advanced HTML Project

## Description
This project focuses on building a solid foundation in HTML by implementing a webpage based on a design provided in Figma. The primary goal is to translate the visual wireframe into an HTML structure, without worrying about styling or layout.

## Objectives
By the end of this project, I aim to:
- Master the ability to translate designs into HTML structures.
- Implement semantic HTML tags to create a clear and accessible structure.
- Use best practices in HTML coding, including validation with W3C tools.
- Prepare the HTML skeleton for future styling with CSS and interaction with JavaScript.

## Requirements
- The project should end with a newline in all files.
- No external libraries or frameworks (only pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
- The code should validate successfully using the W3C Validator.

## Tools and Resources
- [Figma Design](#) *(Add a link to the specific Figma file if possible)*.
- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- [MDN HTML Best Practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Best_practices).
